# Inactivity-by-qualification-and-age
This R script downloads the latest year's Annual Population Survey data for the relevant dataset cells from the NOMIS (www.nomisweb.co.uk) API. 
It then reads this in to R, processes the data to identify qualification and age, and then produces and saves a chart.
The script will pick up the latest data with details of economic activity by age, which is only published for the January to December dataset each year.
